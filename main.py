    st.info("""

    The Startup Analyzer employs sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft extensive research reports on startups or companies. Here's the process:

    1. **User Input**: Begin by entering the name of a startup or company you wish to investigate. You can also incorporate your personal "field notes" to enhance the AI's output.
    
    2. **AI Agents at Work**: Langchain Agents are deployed to retrieve and refine the relevant data about the specified company.
    
    3. **Deep Dive with LLM**: The accumulated data undergoes a thorough analysis by the LLM, yielding insights that span the company's value proposition, business strategy, market opportunities, leadership dynamics, and more.
    
    4. **Customization via Advanced Filters**: Tailor the AI's operations using the advanced filters. Currently, the app supports OpenAI's GPT Models, and you can modulate the AI's temperature to tweak the style and depth of the ensuing report.
    
    5. **Final Report**: The culmination is a detailed research report, accessible directly on the platform or available for download for offline perusal.
    
    The overarching objective is to equip investors, analysts, and the curious-minded with a potent tool that expedites comprehensive research.
